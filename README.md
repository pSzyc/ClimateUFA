# Discourse Changes in Polish Newspapers

This repository contains code and data for the research project "Discourse Changes in Polish Newspapers," conducted by students from the University of Warsaw (Faculty of Physics & Faculty of Polish Studies).

## Project Overview
The project analyzes how discourse in major Polish newspapers has evolved over time, with a focus on topics such as climate change and environmental issues. The repository provides tools for:

- **Web scraping**: Collecting articles from various Polish news sources.
- **Text extraction**: Processing PDF and EPUB files to extract article content.
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning, tokenizing, and preparing text data for analysis.
- **Classification**: Machine learning models for classifying articles and detecting discourse patterns.
- **Visualization**: Generating plots and visualizations (e.g., t-SNE, n-grams) to illustrate findings.
- **UFA implementation**: Python implementation of Unsupervised Feature Analysis (UFA) for text data.
